This guide will demonstrate two separate crosschain transactions:

1. $LTC from Wanchain to Litecoin using the [Wanchain Desktop Wallet](https://www.wanchain.org/wanwallet)
2. $LTC from Litecoin to Wanchain using the [WanBridge web portal](https://bridge.wanchain.org/#/)

> Note: All crosschain transactions between EVM networks follow the same process. This includes all supported EVM networks including Wanchain, Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Fantom, Moonriver, Moonbeam, etc.

## Wanchain to Litecoin crosschain transactions using the WanBridge web portal

### Step 1: Make sure you have the appropriate wallets installed.

Before completing decentralised crosschain transactions using the [WanBridge web portal](https://bridge.wanchain.org/#/), you need to ensure you have access to the correct wallet(s). You must have wallets for each network involved in the crosschain transaction. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) is a fantastic wallet that grants you access to any EVM-compatible blockchain networks.

[Download Metamask here](https://metamask.io/).

### Step 2: Visit the [WanBridge web portal](https://bridge.wanchain.org/) and connect your wallet.

Click “**Connect to Wallet**”.

If this is your first time using the [WanBridge web portal](https://bridge.wanchain.org/#/), you will first need to give permission to connect your wallet. Follow the MetaMask prompts by clicking “**Next**” then “**Connect**” as instructed.

### Step 3: Initiate a crosschain transaction to move your $LTC from Wanchain to Litecoin.

Select “**LTC**” from the drop-down menu. Then, choose “**Wanchain**” and “**Litecoin**” as your _From_ and _To_ networks, respectively. Finally, input your destination address in the “**Recipient**” field as well as the amount of $AVAX you want to send crosschain. Click “**Next**”.

### Step 4: Wait for your crosschain transaction to complete. It is now processing.

While your crosschain transaction is processing, the status will change three times:

* Processing (1/2)
* Processing (2/2)
* Success

> Note: The speed of the crosschain transaction is entirely dependent on the networks involved. Transactions involving slower networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum may take several minutes or more to complete.

### Step 5: Confirm the receipt of your funds. Your crosschain transaction is complete!

Once your crosschain transaction is complete, you’ll see your $LTC balance on Litecoin and the crosschain transaction status change to “**Success**”.

## Litecoin to Wanchain crosschain transactions using the WanBridge web portal

### Step 1: Make sure you have the appropriate wallets installed.

Before completing decentralised crosschain transactions using the [WanBridge web portal](https://bridge.wanchain.org/#/), you need to ensure you have access to the correct wallet(s). You must have wallets for each network involved in the crosschain transaction. When transferring from networks that do not support native smart contracts, you will be instructed to manually send a transaction to initiate the crosschain transaction. It is highly recommended to only use a wallet that you own and control.

### Step 2: Visit [https://bridge.wanchain.org/](https://bridge.wanchain.org/).

### Step 4: Manually send your $LTC to the One-time Address.

Copy the One-time Address and manually transfer the listed number of $LTC using the Litecoin wallet of your choice. It is highly recommended to use a Litecoin wallet that you own and control.

> Note: Be sure to send the correct number of $LTC, as indicated. Send the entire amount as ONE transaction.
