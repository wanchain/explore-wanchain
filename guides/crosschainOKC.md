# How to complete a crosschain transaction (OKC)

An in-depth guide outlining how to complete OKC crosschain transactions using the [WanBridge web portal](https://bridge.wanchain.org/#/).

This guide will demonstrate two separate crosschain transactions:

1. $WAN from Wanchain to OKC using the [WanBridge web portal](https://bridge.wanchain.org/#/)
2. $OKT from OKC to Avalanche using the [WanBridge web portal](https://bridge.wanchain.org/#/)

> Note: All crosschain transactions between EVM networks follow the same process. This includes all supported EVM networks including Wanchain, Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Fantom, Moonriver, Moonbeam, etc.

## Wanchain to OKC crosschain transactions using the WanBridge web portal with Metamask

### Step 1: Make sure you have the appropriate wallets installed.

Before completing decentralised crosschain transactions using the [WanBridge web portal](https://bridge.wanchain.org/#/), you need to ensure you have access to the correct wallet(s). You must have wallets for each network involved in the crosschain transaction. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) is a fantastic wallet that grants you access to any EVM-compatible blockchain networks.

[Download Metamask here](https://metamask.io/).

### Step 2: Visit the WanBridge web portal and connect your wallet.

Click “**Connect to Wallet**”.

Click “**MetaMask**”.

If this is your first time using the [WanBridge web portal](https://bridge.wanchain.org/#/), you will first need to give permission to connect your wallet. Follow the MetaMask prompts by clicking “**Next**” then “**Connect**” as instructed.

### Step 3: Initiate a crosschain transaction to move your $WAN from Wanchain to OKC.

Select “**WAN**” from the drop-down menu. Then, choose “**Wanchain**” and “**OKC**” as your _From_ and _To_ networks, respectively. Finally, input your destination address in the “**Recipient**” field as well as the amount of $WAN you want to send crosschain. Click “**Next**”.

Confirm that the "**Recipient**" address does not belong to a centralised exchange then click "**Confirm**".

Confirm that all the details are correct then click “**Confirm**”.

Confirm the transaction by clicking “**Confirm**” in the MetaMask pop-up window.

### Step 4: Wait for your crosschain transaction to complete. It is now processing.

While your crosschain transaction is processing, the status will change three times:

* Processing (1/2)
* Processing (2/2)
* Success

> Note: The speed of the crosschain transaction is entirely dependent on the networks involved. Transactions involving slower networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum may take several minutes or more to complete.

### Step 5: Confirm the receipt of your funds. Your crosschain transaction is complete!

Once your crosschain transaction is complete, you’ll see your $WAN balance on Wanchain (called $WANw) and the crosschain transaction status change to “**success**”.

### Step 3: Initiate a crosschain transaction to move your $OKT from OKC to Avalanche.

Select “**OKT**” from the drop-down menu. Then, choose “**OKC**” and “**Avalanche C-Chain**” as your _From_ and _To_ networks, respectively. Finally, input your destination address in the “**Recipient**” field as well as the amount of $OKT you want to send crosschain. Click “**Next**”.
