## Crosschain transactions using the WanBridge web portal

### $BTC crosschain transaction from Wanchain to Bitcoin

#### Step 1: Make sure you have the appropriate wallets installed.

Before completing decentralised crosschain transactions using the [WanBridge web portal](https://bridge.wanchain.org/#/), you need to ensure you have access to the correct wallet(s). You must have wallets for each network involved in the crosschain transaction. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) is a fantastic wallet that grants you access to any EVM-compatible blockchain networks.

[Download Metamask here](https://metamask.io/).

#### Step 2: Visit the WanBridge web portal and connect your wallet.

Click “**Connect to Wallet**”.

Click “**Metamask**”.

If this is your first time using the [WanBridge web portal](https://bridge.wanchain.org/#/), you will first need to give permission to connect your wallet. Follow the MetaMask prompts by clicking “**Next**” then “**Connect**” as instructed.

#### Step 3: Initiate a crosschain transaction to move your $BTC from Wanchain to Bitcoin.

Select “**BTC**” from the drop-down menu. Then, choose “**Wanchain**” and “**Bitcoin**” as your _From_ and _To_ networks, respectively. Finally, input your destination address in the “**Recipient**” field as well as the amount of $BTC you want to send crosschain. Click “**Next**”.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*nADtY0h5Wwk2qwD8KIPNZw.png)

While your crosschain transaction is processing, the status will change three times:

* Processing (1/2)
* Processing (2/2)
* Success

> **Note:** The speed of the crosschain transaction is entirely dependent on the networks involved. Transactions involving slower networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum may take several minutes or more to complete.

### $BTC crosschain transaction from Bitcoin to Wanchain

#### Step 1: Make sure you have the appropriate wallets installed.

Before completing decentralised crosschain transactions using the [WanBridge web portal](https://bridge.wanchain.org/#/), you need to ensure you have access to the correct wallet(s). You must have wallets for each network involved in the crosschain transaction. When transferring from networks that do not support native smart contracts, you will be instructed to manually send a transaction to initiate the crosschain transaction. It is highly recommended to only use a wallet that you own and control.

#### Step 2: Visit the WanBridge web portal.
