## Before we start, what is a Wanchain PoS Validator Node? And is it safe to delegate your $WAN?

Wanchain PoS Validator Nodes secure the Wanchain blockchain network by proposing, validating, and finalising blocks. These PoS Validator Nodes reach consensus using a proprietary Proof of Stake consensus algorithm called Galaxy Consensus. PoS Validator Nodes need to stake WAN tokens before they can validate transactions on the network. For detailed information about the Galaxy Consensus, please read the [whitepaper](https://www.wanchain.org/files/Galaxy_Consensus_Paper_EN.pdf).

Delegating to a Wanchain PoS Validator Node is very safe; your $WAN never leaves your custody. When you delegate your $WAN, your $WAN is locked in a smart contract. Even if the PoS Validator Node you chose to delegate to ends up going offline, you will still be able to claim your $WAN and return your coins to your wallet address.

## Step 1. Install the Wanchain Desktop Wallet

### Click “Next” once you have backed up your seed words.

This step is very important! You need to carefully write down your 12 seed words, in order, on a piece of paper. **Saving them digitally is unsafe**. Best practice is to make multiple copies of your seed words and keep them in different secure locations.

> Note: Your seed words are the keys to your wallet. Never share them with anyone under any circumstances. Scammers can steal your funds if they have your seed words. _**Keep them safe**_!

### Input your seed words in order by clicking the words then click “Done”.

This is to confirm your seed words were written down correctly. If you make a mistake here, you can click “Previous” to go back and try again.

### Fund your account with some $WAN.

From your $WAN account overview, you can edit your account name, create more wallets, copy your public address and send $WAN to other addresses.

**You’ll need at least 100 $WAN for delegating and some extra for gas (0.1 $WAN).**

> Note: You can buy $WAN on any of these [markets](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wanchain/markets/). Alternatively, you crosschain some assets using [Wanchain’s crosschain bridge](https://bridge.wanchain.org/#/) thens get some $WAN on [WanSwap](https://www.wanswap.finance/#/swap). All crosschain transactions are eligible to automatically receive a bit of $WAN from Wanchain’s [universal crosschain faucet](https://medium.com/wanchain-foundation/interoperable-defi-made-easy-wan-cross-chain-faucet-now-supports-all-tokens-e68be483739).
