# Storeman Nodes  

Wanchain's storeman node system is at the core of its cross chain technology. Storeman nodes are nodes which verify cross chain transactions and ensure the smooth and secure transfer of value between heterogenous blockchains. Through the application of multipary computation and threshold secret sharing, the storeman nodes work together to perform cross chain transactions without revealing the private keys of the accounts involved. To ensure their honest behavior, node operators are required to put up collateral which coveres the value of any transactions they process.
