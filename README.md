# Introduction  

### What is Wanchain?
Wanchain is a public blockchain with support for the development of smart contracts using Solidity. Wanchain supports ring signature based private transactions and decentralized cross chain functionality.

Wanchain's [Storeman node](technology/storeman.md) system uniquely combines  secure multiparty computation, atomic swaps, threshold secret sharing, and decentralized account management to implement a decentralized cross chain solution.

A developer can write smart contracts, build a DAPP or issue a fungible/non-fungible token on wanchain. 

Through Wanchain's cross chain features, it is possible for any blockchain's assets to be connected with and circulate on Wanchain. This includes assets from public, private, as well as consortium chains.


### Vision

Wanchain's vision is to become the asset transport layer of the blockchain world, similar to the TCP transport layer of the Internet, only for assets based on distributed ledger technology. Currently, the only way to efficiently transfer value between isolated blockchains is either P2P or through the use of a trusted third party such as a centralized cryptocurrency exchange or OTC trading desk. Since the abolition of the reliance on trusted 3rd parties is one of the core goals of the blockchain revolution, it is clear that a solution must be implemented to do away with them. Wanchain aims to be that solution. As the asset transport layer of the blockchain world, Wanchain will allow for direct transfer of value between blockchains without the use of a trusted 3rd party. It will allow for the development of entirely decentralized and unstoppable cross chain cryptocurrency exchanges and applications.
