IMPORTANT: Next record your backup mnemonic phrase. Do not take a screenshot, rather you should write it by hand. Do not share your phrase with anyone. This phrase is the only way to recover your account.

## Cross Chain Transactions

The Desktop Light Wallet lets you quickly and easily make cross chain transactions. 

To get started, click on the 'Cross Chain' tab on the side menu:   

 ![](media/wan_wallet_24.png)

Then choose the asset from the drop down menu you would like to make a cross chain transaction with, and click the 'Convert' button:

*(if the asset you wish to make a transaction with is not displayed, you can add additional Wanchain supported assets from the menu in 'Settings' --> 'Config' --> 'Wallet Options')*

 ![](media/wan_wallet_25.png)

After clicking convert, a form will pop up with pre-populated values. 

* 'From (Ethereum)' - Shows account type and name of the 'From' address
* 'Balance' - Shows the current balance of the asset in the 'From' address
* 'Storeman' - Shows the address of the Storeman who your transaction will be sent to
* 'Capacity' - Shows the total capacity of cross chain assets which the Storeman is able to manage. 
* 'Capacity Left' - Shows the remaining capacity of the Storeman. 
*For the above five fields, you do not need to change anything. You only need to make certain that your transaction value does not go over the Storeman's capacity.*
* 'To' - Here you can select the target address where the cross chain asset generated from 'From' address will arrive on the target chain. 
* 'Estimated Fee' - Shows the estimated fees of the cross chain transaction on both chains.
* 'Amount' - This is the amount of the asset you wish to send in your cross chain transaction.

After carefully filling in the 'To' and 'Amount' fields, click 'Next' to review your information and then 'Send' to begin the transaction.

 ![](media/wan_wallet_26.png)

You may then check your transaction's current state under 'Transaction History' --> 'Status'. The entire transaction should take several minutes, perhaps longer depending on the current network conditions. Immediately after clicking 'Send', the status should say 'Lock Request Sent'.

 ![](media/wan_wallet_27.png)

Shortly after the status will change to 'Locked'.

 ![](media/wan_wallet_28.png)

Next the status will change to 'Redemption Request Sent'.
 
 ![](media/wan_wallet_29.png)

And finally, the transaction status will change to 'Success', and the newly generated cross chain token will be available for you to transact with in your target 'To' address.

  ![](media/wan_wallet_30.png)

The process for returning your asset back to the original chain is the same, except this time click the 'Convert' button on the cross chained asset instead of the native asset, and follow the same instructions as listed above.


## Delegation
Wanchain's newly introduced Galaxy Consensus Proof of Stake has a completely non-custodial delegation mechanism. Users may choose from amongst all available validators the one which they trust to send their delegations too. By delegating their stake to validator nodes in this way, all users have the opportunity to earn consensus rewards. The minimum required amount for delegation is 100 WAN. 

Within the delegation interface users may clearly check their amount of staked WAN, their accumulated rewards from delegation, the yearly return rate for the entire network, and pending withdrawals. Users can also check a table of all their previous delegation transaction history. 

![](media/wan_wallet_7.png)

In order to make a new delegation, click 'New Delegation', choose a validator from the list, under 'My Account', choose the account from which you would like to delegate, and enter the amount you would like to delegate in the 'Amount' field. During the process of delegation, there are several parameters you should pay attention to. First, the validator's 'Quota' represents the amount of WAN that validator is able to accept in delegations. Please also note the 'Fee' parameter. This parameter is the percent fee charged as commission by the validator. For example, if the network reward is 50 WAN and the fee is 15%, then you will receive 42.5 WAN as your reward, and 7.5 WAN will be paid to the validator.

In the images below, a user is delegating 100 WAN to a validator node. 

![](media/wan_wallet_8.png)
![](media/wan_wallet_9.png)

After a completing a delegation, you can see 100 WAN displayed under "My Delegations." Previous delegation details may be viewed from within the delegations history. If the user wishes to increase their delegation, they may click on the 'Top up' button. 

**Note:** Users may exit their delegation at any time, but please note there is ~3 epoch unlocking period after which you can withdraw your WAN.

**Note:** Be sure to turn Contract Data on if you are using a Ledger hardware wallet.

![](media/wan_wallet_10.png)

## Validator Node Registration
To access the validator node menu, make sure that you have checked the "Enable Validator" box inside the Settings menu. The "Validator" option will then appear under the "Galaxy PoS" tab on the left.

![](media/wan_wallet_16.png)

To register your validator node and start staking, click "Register".

![](media/wan_wallet_17.png)

Fill in all the required parameters which were obtained during your [validator setup](staking/node-setup-mainnet) under the "Validator Account" section, and fill in all the information from your funding wallet under "My Account". If you are using Ledger, make certain that you have turned Contract Data on in the settings. When selecting locking period, please note that the longer your locking period, the higher your reward rate. Please use the [staking calculator](http://calculator.wandevs.org/) for reward rate estimates.

![](media/wan_wallet_18.png)

## Hardware Wallet
Currently the Ledger hardware wallet is supported. Follow the on screen instructions to connect your Ledger. Other hardware wallets may be supported in the future. Make sure to turn Contract Data on for validation or delegation transactions.

## Privacy Transaction
Privacy transactions on Wanchain are a way for a user to send WAN to another user without specifying who is the recipient. With a privacy transaction the world can see that a user made a transaction, and upon a deeper inspection of the transaction can see how much WAN was sent in the transaction, but the world cannot see who the recipient will be. Privacy transactions are carried out on Wanchain by way of a smart contract built into the protocol.

Allowed amounts for privacy transactions:
- 10 WAN
- 20 WAN
- 50 WAN
- 100 WAN
- 200 WAN
- 500 WAN
- 1000 WAN
- 5000 WAN
- 50000 WAN

When locking funds into the privacy contract, a user can thus only lock an amount in the list above. Likewise, a user cannot redeem partial amounts, but must redeem the full amount that was locked to the one-time address.

Go to **Wallet** -> **WAN** -> **@Wanchain**, and choose the WAN address that you want to receive WAN with privacy transaction method. Click the arrow to show a "long address" accordingly, and copy this long address.

![](media/wan_wallet_40.jpeg)

Choose your sender address, and click **Send**. Paste your long address to the To row. In this case, the **Transaction Mode** will automatically change to **Private Transaction**. Meanwhile, enter the **amount** and select the **Fee**. Click **Next**.

![](media/wan_wallet_41.jpeg)

Review the Confirm Transaction window, and click Send.

![](media/wan_wallet_42.jpeg)

After around 1 minute, you will receive WAN in the recipient's long address. Click the arrow on the right and then click the button **Redeem**.

![](media/wan_wallet_43.jpeg)

After around half a minute, you will finally receive WAN in your recipient's ordinary address.

**Note: Make sure that both of your sender address and recipient address has enough WAN for the gas fees.**


## DApp Store

[Video guide](https://youtu.be/dMpabWAR-iw)

The DApp Store feature of Wan Wallet allows you to experience DApps from creators in the Wanchain ecosystem. In the DApp Store you can find new DApps and add them to your wallet. After adding them to your wallet, you may then directly interact with the DApps through the wallet interface.

Under 'Backup', you may enter your password to get your backup mnemonic phrase.

![](media/wan_wallet_13.png)

Under 'DApps', you may hide or delete DApps you are not currently using.

![](media/wan_wallet_22.png)
